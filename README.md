# WorkAssignment
A corebos module that lets you create Work Assignments (on location) for users

## Changes that need to be in corebos
- InventoryLine, InventoryField and InventoryBlock need to be in Inventory.js
- Sortable needs to be included
- cbNumber and ldsCheckbox need to be in general.js
- Components in smarty Components
- Styles in style.css

## Todo
- Create event listener for the deletion or creation of taxes
- Create address fields
- Handle conversion from other records
- handle duplication
- Join retrieving existing inventorylines on services as well, right now it's only products
